    summary: |
      With over a decade of diverse experience across multiple fields, I have developed a versatile skill set.
      In a B2B context, I successfully managed sales operations,
      leveraging email marketing strategies based on web scraping and data analysis to achieve significant results despite a limited budget. 
      Additionally, I have experience in real estate, where I optimized marketing tools and processes,
      ensuring efficient data management, and also worked as a realtor.

      Currently, I work as a cost analyst at an industrial level, managing financial data related to the cost of production and the product itself.
      I also perform analyses of other departments, such as production, sales, and inventory, providing insights based on their specific departmental data.
      This role provides me with a comprehensive understanding of the company's operations
      I am also expanding my analytical capabilities by studying data science, further enhancing my ability to drive business insights and growth.
